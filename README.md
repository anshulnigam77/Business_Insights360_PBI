AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in selling PC electronic items, needed a comprehensive data intelligence solution to provide actionable insights to its Finance, Sales, Marketing, Executive, and Supply Chain departments. The goal was to present data in a concise and visual format to facilitate informed decision-making.

## Obejective

The report needed to include P&L statements, sales analysis, marketing metrics, supply chain views, and an executive dashboard.
